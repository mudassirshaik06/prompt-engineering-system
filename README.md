## Who Am I?
I am Mudassir Shaik, a self-trained Prompt Engineer focused on designing high-quality prompts that transform Large Language Models (LLMs) into reliable, task-specific systems.

This repository proves my ability to:
- Think in systems, not just questions
- Design prompts for real-world use cases
- Control AI behavior, tone, structure, and output quality

## What Is Prompt Engineering (My Definition)
Prompt Engineering is the skill of converting human intent into structured instructions that an AI can consistently follow.

A good prompt:
- Reduces ambiguity
- Sets clear roles and constraints
- Produces repeatable, high-quality outputs

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Role-based prompting
- Step-by-step instruction design
- Output formatting control
- Error prevention prompts
- User-behavior-aware prompts
- Prompt optimization & refinement

---

## Project Structure
This repository will contain:
- Prompt templates
- Real-world use-case prompts
- Before/After prompt comparisons
- Prompt improvement logs

---

## Why This Repository Exists
Most people *use* AI.
Very few people *control* AI.

This repository exists to show that I belong to the second category.
